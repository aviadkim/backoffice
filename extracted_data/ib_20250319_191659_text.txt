# Notes and Disclosure 

1. The Net Asset Value (NAV) consists of all positions by financial instrument (stock, securities options, warrants, bonds, cash, etc.). All non-base currency amounts are converted to the base currency at the close of period rate.
2. The deposit/withdrawal amount displayed in the Account Overview report includes internal transfers along with cash and position transfers.
3. The gain or loss for future contracts settle into cash each night. The notional value is used when computing the contribution to return.
4. Dividend accruals, interest accruals and insured deposits are included in cash amounts throughout the report.
5. Price valuations are obtained from outside parties. Interactive Brokers shall have no responsibility for the accuracy or timeliness of any such price valuation.
6. Data from Thomson Reuters Business Classifications and Lipper Global is used to derive our sector classifications. Funds with assorted sector allocations are classified as Broad.
7. Amounts are formatted to two decimal places. If amounts are greater than two decimal places, Interactive Brokers uses "half-even" rounding. This means that Interactive Brokers rounds such amounts up to the nearest even number.
8. Historical US 3 Month Treasury Bill rates are used as the risk free rates when calculating Alpha ( $\alpha$ ), the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio, and the downside deviation.
9. The mean return is the average TWR for the period.
10. Frongello is the method used for mathematical smoothing in the Performance Attribution report. It has been developed by Andrew Scott Bay Frongello.

13. The Modified Dietz method is used to calculate MWR. This method only values the portfolio at the start and end of the period and weights the cash flows. When large flows occur, its accuracy can diminish.
14. The Estimated Annual Income and Estimated Remaining Income in the Projected Income report assume dividend and bond payments remain constant throughout the year. These positions and interest rates are based on the previous business day.
