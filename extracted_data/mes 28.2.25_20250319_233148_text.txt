# Product Risk Classifier (PRC) 

The PRC (Product Risk Classifier) is a risk indicator, provided by third parties, which is based on quantitative models. This provides an indication of the financial risk of the individual investment products and therefore allows comparing the financial risk of financial instruments belonging to various asset categories and classes.
This value is calculated by taking into consideration the three basis aspects of an investment product's financial risk: the market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Portfolio Risk Classifer (PRC) is measured on a scale that goes from 1 (very low risk) to 5 (very high risk).

## Performance

Performance is the percentage trend in asset value and therefore expresses the return on a securities portfolio over a given period of time. The performance indicator is expressed as "Total Return". In fact, the calculation takes not only price gains/losses into account but also interest (including pro rata interest) and dividend payments.
The Bank calculates performance using the TWR (Time-Weighted Return) calculation method, which measures the compound rate of return on a portfolio, eliminating the impact of any cash flows made by the investor (deposits or withdrawals).
Performance is stated net, i.e. performance net of taxes and of transaction and management fees.
The asset valuation reports the information available at the time of preparation of the asset valuation for the relevant valuation date.
